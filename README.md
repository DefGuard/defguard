Defguard is an open-source security *swiss army knife* (Identity, MFA, VPN, Yubikey, Web3).

Building a secure organization has always been difficult and costly. Defguard provides a beautiful, easy-to-use (business users) and deploy (admin/devops) fundament to make your organization secure.

**Why?**

The story and motivation behind defguard [can be found here: https://teonite.com/blog/defguard/](https://teonite.com/blog/defguard/)

**Features:**

* OpenID Connect provider (with OpenLDAP synchronization)
* [Wireguard:tm:](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN management with:
  - import your current configuration (with a wizzard!)
  - *easy* device setup by users themselves
  - dashboard and statistics overview of connected users/devices for admins
* Multi-Factor Authentication:
  - Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)
  - WebAuthn / FIDO2 - for hardware key authentication support (eg. YubiKey, FaceID, TouchID, ...)
  - Web3 - authentication with crypto software and hardware wallets using Metamask, Wallet Connect, Ledger Extension
* [Yubikey hardware keys](https://www.yubico.com/) provisioning for users by *one click*
* Webhooks & REST API
* Web3 wallet validation
* Build with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for portability, security, and speed
* Fronted in TypeScript with:
  - a set of components for layout
  - Responsive Web Design (supporting mobile phones, tablets, etc..)
  - [iOS Web App](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-web-apps-iphone-ipad/)
* Checked by professional security researchers (see [comprehensive security report](https://defguard.net/images/decap/isec-defguard.pdf))
* End2End tests

# Deployment

* Using [Docker Compose](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance/docker-compose)
* Using [Kubernetes](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance/kubernetes)

# Development environment setup

Remember to clone DefGuard repository recursively (with protos):

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:DefGuard/defguard.git
```

## With Docker Compose

Using Docker Compose you can setup a simple stack with:

* backend
* database (PostgreSQL)
* VPN gateway
* device connected to the gateway
* ldap

This way you'll have some live stats data to work with.

To do so follow these steps:

1. Migrate database and insert test network and device:

```
docker compose run core init-dev-env
```

2. Run the application:

Without LDAP:

```
docker compose up
```

With LDAP:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.ldap.yaml up
```

## Cargo

To run backend without Docker, you'll need:

* PostgreSQL database
* environment variables set

Run PostgreSQL with:

```
docker compose up -d db
```

You'll find environment variables in .env file. Source them however you like (we recommend https://direnv.net/).
Once that's done, you can run backend with:

```
cargo run
```
