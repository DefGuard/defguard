### Comprehensive Access Control

- **[WireGuard® VPN with 2FA/MFA](https://docs.defguard.net/admin-and-features/wireguard/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa/architecture)** - not 2FA to "access application" like most solutions
  - The only solution with [automatic and real-time synchronization](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/automatic-real-time-desktop-client-configuration) for users' desktop client settings (including all VPNs/locations).
  - Control users [ability to manage devices and VPN options](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/behavior-customization)
- [Integrated SSO based on OpenID Connect](https://docs.defguard.net/admin-and-features/openid-connect):
  - significant cost saving, simplifying deployment and maintenance
  - enabling features unavailable to VPN platforms relying upon 3rd party SSO integration
- Already using Google/Microsoft or other OpenID Provider? - [external OpenID provider support](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/external-openid-providers)
- Only solution with [secure remote user Enrollment & Onboarding](https://docs.defguard.net/help/enrollment)
- Yubico YubiKey Hardware [security key management and provisioning](https://docs.defguard.net/admin-and-features/yubikey-provisioning)
- Secure and robust architecture, featuring components and micro-services seamlessly deployable in diverse network setups (eg. utilizing network segments like Demilitarized Zones, Intranet with no external access, etc), ensuring a secure environment.
- Enterprise ready (multiple Locations/Gateways/Kubernetes deployment, etc..)
- Built on WireGuard® protocol which is faster than IPSec, and significantly faster than OpenVPN
- Built with Rust for speed and security

#### Dark

![defguard WireGuard MFA](https://github.com/DefGuard/docs/blob/docs/releases/0.9/mfa.png?raw=true)

[Desktop client](https://github.com/DefGuard/client):

- **2FA / Multi-Factor Authentication** with TOTP or email based tokens & WireGuard PSK
- [automatic and real-time synchronization](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/automatic-real-time-desktop-client-configuration) for users' desktop client settings (including all VPNs/locations).
- Control users [ability to manage devices and VPN options](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/behavior-customization)
- Defguard instances as well as **any WireGuard tunnel** - just import your tunnels - one client for all WireGuard connections
- Secure and remote user enrollment - setting up password, automatically configuring the client for all VPN Locations/Networks
- Onboarding - displaying custom onboarding messages, with templates, links ...
- Ability to route predefined VPN traffic or all traffic (server needs to have NAT configured - in gateway example)
- Live & real-time network charts
- live VPN logs
- light/dark theme

## Quick start

The easiest way to run your own defguard instance is to use Docker and our [one-line install script](https://docs.defguard.net/features/setting-up-your-instance/one-line-install).
Just run the command below in your shell and follow the prompts:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefGuard/deployment/main/docker-compose/setup.sh -O && bash setup.sh
```

Here is a step-by-step video about this process:
