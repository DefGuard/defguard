[Website](https://defguard.net) | [Getting Started](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/#what-is-defguard) | [Features](https://github.com/defguard/defguard#features) | [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/defguard/projects/5) | [Support ❤](https://github.com/defguard/defguard#support-)

- Real [WireGuard® MFA](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/admin-and-features/wireguard/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa/architecture) (not 2FA to "access application" like most solutions)
- Integrated SSO based on OpenID Connect: 
    - significant cost saving, simplifying deployment and maintenance
    - enabling features unavailable to VPN platforms relying upon 3rd party SSO integration
- Already using Google/Microsoft or other OpenID Provider? - integrated external OpenID provider support 
- Yubico YubiKey Hardware security key management and provisioning 
- Secure and robust architecture, featuring components and micro-services seamlessly deployable in diverse network setups (eg. utilizing  network segments like Demilitarized Zones, Intranet with no external access, etc), ensuring a secure environment.
- Enterprise ready (multiple Locations/Gateways/Kubernetes deployment, etc..)
- Build on WireGuard® protocol which is faster than IPSec, and significantly faster than OpenVPN
- Build with Rust for speed and security

See below [full list of features](https://github.com/defguard/defguard#features)

[Desktop client](https://github.com/DefGuard/client):
- **2FA / Multi-Factor Authentication** with TOTP or email based tokens & WireGuard PSK
- Defguard instances as well as **any WireGuard tunnel** - just import your tunnels - one client for all WireGuard connections
- Secure and remote user enrollment - setting up password, automatically configuring the client for all VPN Locations/Networks
- Onboarding - displaying custom onboarding messages, with templates, links ...
- Ability to route predefined VPN traffic or all traffic (server needs to have NAT configured - in gateway example)
- Live & real-time network charts
- live VPN logs
- light/dark theme

## Quick start

The easiest way to run your own defguard instance is to use Docker and our [one-line install script](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance/one-line-install).

Just run the command below in your shell and follow the prompts:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefGuard/deployment/main/docker-compose/setup.sh -O && bash setup.sh
```

To learn more about the script and available options please see the [documentation](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance/one-line-install).

## Features

* [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN server with:
  - Real and unique [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/help/desktop-client/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa) with TOTP/Email & Pre-Shared Session Keys
  - multiple VPN Locations (networks/sites) - with defined access (all users or only Admin group)
  - multiple [Gateways](https://github.com/DefGuard/gateway) for each VPN Location (**high availability/failover**) - supported on a cluster of routers/firewalls for Linux, FreeBSD/PFSense/OPNSense
  - **import your current WireGuard® server configuration (with a wizard!)**
  - **most beautiful [Desktop Client!](https://github.com/defguard/client)** (in our opinion ;-))
  - automatic IP allocation
  - kernel (Linux, FreeBSD/OPNSense/PFSense) & userspace WireGuard® support with [our Rust library](https://github.com/defguard/wireguard-rs)
  - dashboard and statistics overview of connected users/devices for admins
  - *defguard is not an official WireGuard® project, and WireGuard is a registered trademark of Jason A. Donenfeld.*
* Integrated SSO: [OpenID Connect provider](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) - with **unique features**:
  - Secure remote (over the internet) [user enrollment](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/help/remote-user-enrollment)
  - User [onboarding after enrollment](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/help/remote-user-enrollment/user-onboarding-after-enrollment)
  - LDAP (tested on [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/)) synchronization
  - [forward auth](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/forward-auth) for reverse proxies (tested with Traefik and Caddy)

  - [Multi-Factor/2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) Authentication:
   - [Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)

   - Email based TOTP
* Extenal SSO: [External OpenID Providers support](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/admin-and-features/external-openid-providers) - *in testing, [watch this issue](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/issues/602)* - Google, Microsoft or custom 
* SSH & GPG public key management in user profile - with [SSH keys authentication for servers](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/admin-and-features/ssh-authentication)
* [Yubikey hardware keys](https://www.yubico.com/) provisioning for users by *one click*
