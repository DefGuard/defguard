//! Event description generation for activity log.
//!
//! This module provides functions to generate human-readable descriptions for various
//! types of events that occur within the system. These descriptions are used to provide usable
//! context about what happened during each event.
//!
//! Each event type has its own description generator function that takes the event data
//! and returns an optional description string. Some events may not require additional
//! description beyond their event type name, in which case `None` is returned.
